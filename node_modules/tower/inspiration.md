## Discussions

- Should we rename "views" to "templates", and have the client use "views"?

## Lessons Learned

#### Set the example

I wrote long and detailed responses to every single issue, and people consistently were very impressed.  After a short while (1-2 months) 2-3 guys started responding to others in the community with long and detailed replies, getting the same responses.  https://github.com/edubkendo/demoApp/issues/1#issuecomment-5412197

#### It's all about the demo (and marketing)

Read the book Positioning by Jack Trout.  Meteor came out and got 2,500 watchers in under a week, Tower stabled out at 800 after 2 months.

#### Do not hide mistakes

Tower had a security vulnerability right off the bat.  I quickly fixed it (within 45 minutes) and was tempted to cover it up.  Instead, it's far better to expose your mistakes, so I apologized (modeling GitHub's response to the hacker).  Take the upfront ego hit, and the pain's gone in less than a day.  Otherwise you'll be known for not being transparent and honest.  It's infinitely better to be known as a man of good character.
